# Transfer-Learning
Starting with a model pretrained on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet, COCO) and fine-tuning it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This technique is crucial when labeled data is limited and helps improve model performance by leveraging learned features from large, general datasets.
